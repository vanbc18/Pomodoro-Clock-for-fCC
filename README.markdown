The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

However, you can increase or decrease your break & study session time length on this clock, and it'll give you a beep signal when either session is over.
You can also reset the clock at any given time and use this clock to boost your study performances !

I learnt that the setInterval() function was essential to build a timer.

React was used to render the app, Bootstrap container was used to make it responsive and Bootstrap wells & row classes were used to place everything where I wanted it to be.
